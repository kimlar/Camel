A 3d game engine with a testing level. It does also feature UI and collision. The purpose with this project was to learn OpenGL. It didn't go long before I found myself writing a game engine as I progressed with the OpenGL tutorial. Granted the code for this engine isn't great, but it did help me having a practical experience with OpenGL. In retro perspective, I should have organized this project better, and used more unique pointers instead of plain pointers. In this level you can move your first person camera around, the floor and stairs have collision checking. There is also a window object and a couple of other objects. One of my minor goals was to make a 3d model with Blender. It was pretty cool to just create an object in Blender then export it, and finally have it appear in the game level. The part I found the most difficult in this project was the matrix math. Because you need it for EVERYTHING when dealing with a 3d engine stuff.
